 Treehouse Techdegree Project 2: Mobile-First Responsive Layout

The purpose of this project was to build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS that demonstrates an understanding of responsive design by adjusting to small, medium, and large screen sizes. I was provided starter files that consisted of mockup images for mobile, tablet, and desktop layout.

The basic requirements of this project included: creating file structure; building the layout using a mobile-first approach; getting familiar and comfortable with using Google Fonts to personalize the text; using media queries for tablet and desktop screen width breakpoints; linking navigation menu to sections of the page using IDs and anchor tags; using code validators to check code prior to submitting project.

The extra credit requirements of this project included: adding an additional section to the page and including a link for it in navigation menu; adding at least two of the following--new background color for nav and main sections, color of at least one piece of text, one additional google font, any additional styling for links (ex: borders, hover states); using nav element for the navigation bar for semantic markup.

I went beyond the requirements listed above by: employing different font sizes at each breakpoint; adding all 4 of the styling changes listed above (2 were required for extra credit).
